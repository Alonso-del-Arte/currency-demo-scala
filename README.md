# Currency Demo, Scala

Repository to support my upcoming presentation about Scala and JUnit at the 
Michigan Dev Fest. See the mi-dev-fest-2024 branch for the commits made at the 
event.

I'm using Scala 2 in IntelliJ IDEA with IntelliJ's build tool, running under 
Java 11, with JUnit 5.

This project is closed off to Hacktoberfest.
